# iam-dg-browser-automate-py
Python Selenium scripts that perform browser automation tasks for the dg/mydata project.
While these scripts are designed to be deployed to AppDyanmics, please follow the instructions below
to get the scripts running locally from the command line 

## Running Scripts Locally

These instructions assume you have Homebrew running on a Mac. (see [https://brew.sh/][] for more info)

1. Install Python3 via Homebrew (while python2 comes pre-installed on macos X, python3 rules!)
    $ brew install python
